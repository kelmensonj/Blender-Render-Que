# Blender-Render-Que
This is just a simple Render Que for Blender. Typically in Blender, if you're making an animated movie, you split the movie up into a lot of scenes. Common practice is to do night time renders. I found that when I wanted to render a couple animations, I'd need to start the renders at the same time and my computer crashed and almost self destructed at one point. So, this render que will read the current directory and then render the animations it finds in the directory one at a time.
