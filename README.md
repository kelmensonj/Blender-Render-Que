# Blender-Render-Que
Blender3D is an open source animation software capable of creating super high resolution images and videos. However, animations can take awhile to render and it is common practice to render overnight. This is fine if you have one scene you want to render - but I nearly melted my laptop when I rendered 4+ high resolution scenes overnight. So I created Blender Render Que, which allows you to que up as many blend files as you like and render them one by one, as opposed to all at the same time in separate tabs. I haven't found a better solution than this for when I want to render many scenes in as little time as possible. Below is a simple example:

Side Note: Blender Render Que will load to the que any and all '.blend' files that are in the same directory as the script when you run it. You can remove '.blend' files by clicking them and then hitting 'Delete Selection'.
