# Blender-Render-Que
Blender3D is an open source animation software capable of creating super high resolution images and videos. However, animations can take awhile to render and it is common practice to render overnight. This is fine if you have one scene you want to render - but I nearly melted my laptop when I rendered 4+ high resolution scenes at once. So I created Blender Render Que, which allows you to que up as many blend files as you like and render them one by one, as opposed to all at the same time in separate tabs. Below is a simple example:
